# Deakin Marketplace

Deakin Marketplace was created for Deakin students who want to buy local and international products but may be too busy to shop around Melbourne for the items they need. With the e-commerce platform we built, itâ€™s easier for both local and international students to browse online and have their purchases delivered right to their doorstep.

## Description

The Deakin Marketplace website is tailored for Deakin students, similar to other e-commerce platforms. It offers a unique selection of international goods, spices, and more, not commonly found in Melbourne's grocery stores. This provides students with the convenience of finding what they need with just a click. Additionally, students can also become sellers on the Deakin Marketplace to earn extra income for daily expenses or even tuition fees. With Deakin Marketplace, students can browse their desired items, choose payment methods, view purchase history, and have their orders delivered right to their doorstep.

With Deakin Marketplace, we help improve the lives of many students by providing them with the opportunity to earn money through selling, while also offering convenience to buyers.
